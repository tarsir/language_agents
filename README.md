# Language Agent Simulation

Language evolution is a topic I want to dive into more, so I'm starting this
project to have a personal playground and try out techniques for simulating
language evolution through an agent-based model.

## Take 1

The first implementation will simply be an implementation of
[a paper by Kirby, 2001](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.163.4065&rep=rep1&type=pdf),
in which language evolution is simulated with exactly one learner agent and one
adult agent.
